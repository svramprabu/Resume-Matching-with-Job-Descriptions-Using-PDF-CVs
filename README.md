# Personal Portfolio - Resume Matching Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio showcasing a fascinating project: **Resume Matching**. In this project, I embarked on an exciting journey to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to streamline the hiring process and connect the right candidates with job openings. Here's an overview of the project:

## Project Overview

**Data Collection and Preparation:**
- A dataset containing PDFs of live resumes from a job portal was made available via a web link.
- I extracted information from these PDF resumes and meticulously organized the data into a structured CSV file.

**Job Descriptions:**
- To complete the puzzle, I collected job descriptions from various companies, sourced from Kaggle and provided in CSV format through a data link.

**Data Preprocessing:**
- Ensured that both resume and job description data were cleaned, pre-processed, and tokenized to facilitate further analysis.

**Embedding Using DistilBERT:**
- To unlock the power of contextual embeddings, I utilized DistilBERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to transform the textual data into meaningful numerical representations.

**Cosine Similarity Analysis:**
- Here comes the magic! I computed cosine similarity scores between job descriptions and resumes to determine how well they match.
- The top 5 resumes with the highest cosine similarity scores were selected as the most suitable candidates for each job.

## Why This Project Matters

- **Efficiency**: The project significantly streamlines the hiring process, helping HR professionals and hiring managers save time and resources.
- **Precision**: By leveraging NLP and machine learning, we ensure a higher degree of precision in matching job descriptions with resumes.
- **Personalization**: Tailoring job recommendations based on actual content ensures that candidates are a good fit for the roles they're being considered for.
