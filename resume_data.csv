input distribution is handled and how it can be made efficient, an activity which led to development of electronic voucher system of distributing

Executive Profile
To obtain the job that continues to expand my administrative experience working with staff, students and parents to develop a shared vision and
leading school community in achieving those goals. I firmly believe that all children deserve to have every opportunity to learn in a positive,
supportive environment as well as have a multitude of opportunities to discover and explore areas of interest helping them to develop into a well-
rounded individual who will succeed in the twenty-first century. 
I believe that true leaders exhibit habits of mind and model the expectations they
have of their employees. I believe two critical components of successful leadership are positive relationships and transparency.

Was instrumental in instituting a new scheduling practice that streamlined our booking process.Â  Results of the new scheduling procedure
increased our booking appointments from only booking 1 month out, to booking every 4 to 6 weeks for up to 1 to 2 years out. Â I developed a
new advanced payment option, where the clients can pre-pay onto a debit style card. They can choose the set amount of funds. With this option
they get a percentage discount taken off for booking the year. With these cards they can reload anytime, and with this creative plan it drastically
increased the predictability of the income variables. Â Â

In 1981, before the advent and common use of CAD programs, I had a serious injury to my right (drawing) hand.Â  I was owner of income
properties and had been managing income propertiesfor other individual owners.Â  Since I was not going to be able to use my hand again for
drawing for some time, I took a position as a manager of a 160 unit apartment project that was only 50% occupied.Â  Within six months, all units
were rehabbed, rentable and occupied, and 95-100% occupancy was maintained while I was manager.Â  
In 1983, I was offered a position with another firm as Project Manager during construction and Start-Up Manager of a 360 unit apartment
complex.Â  Being involved at the inception, I was able to revise apartment floor plans to made accommodation for the most common objections I
heard while marketing existing floor plans.Â  My revised plans were very successful and apartments were filled as fast as they were built, with a
long waiting list.Â  Approximately 1/3 of the tenants from the first project I had managed, moved to the new complex, which was extremely
gratifying.Â  I continued in this position to the end of construction.Â  During that time, I attended property management courses and earned a
Residential Property Management Certificate.
My hand was rehabilitated by this time and I decided it was time to return to my real passion, interior design. Â
