different agricultural organization and this created so much diverse views about Zambia's agricultural sector. With ACF I participated in analysis
and evaluation of various agricultural policies in line with how they affect Zambian agricultural sector. This includes the manner in which farming
input distribution is handled and how it can be made efficient, an activity which led to development of electronic voucher system of distributing
farming inputs to the peasant farmers which is yet to be implemented by the Zambian government. The production of policy briefs had a significant
impact in building my strong analytical skills which are always desirable by any institution as it leads to efficiency in operations.
